# Noroff Online Shop

Hi! This is my e-commerce app built with React and TypeScript for the JavaScript Frameworks course. It's a simple online shop where you can browse products, add them to your cart, and checkout.

## What it does

I built this using the Noroff API to fetch product data. You can search for products, sort them by name or price, view details, and manage your shopping cart. There's also a contact form with validation and toast notifications throughout the app.

## How to run it

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`

## Running tests

I added some basic tests with React Testing Library:

```bash
npm test
```

## Tech stack

- React 19 with TypeScript (strict mode)
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite as the build tool
- React Testing Library for tests
